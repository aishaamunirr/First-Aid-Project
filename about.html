                <p> Aidemy is a simple, easy-to-use platform created to teach everyday people the basics of first aid.
                    We believe that life-saving knowledge should not be reserved for professionals only â€” everyone
                    deserves to know what to do in an emergency..</p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>To build a world where anyone, anywhere can respond confidently in emergencies.
                In Nigeria, where medical response can be delayed, Aidemy aims to bridge the gap
                by empowering individuals with practical, accessible first aid skills.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is simple; to make first aid knowledge accessible to everyone,
                regardless of age, background, or location. We want to remove the fear and
                confusion that often come with emergencies by offering clear, step-by-step
                guidance in a language and format that people can understand.
                By focusing on simplicity and practicality, Aidemy empowers individuals
                to take immediate action and provide life-saving support when it matters most.

            <h2>Why Aidemy is Different</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike international apps that focus broadly, Aidemy is built with the Nigerian context in mind.
                We highlight the real challenges of emergency response in our communities,
                and our future plans include support for local languages, cultural relevance,
                and offline access for areas with limited internet.
